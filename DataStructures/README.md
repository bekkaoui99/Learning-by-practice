## Linear Data Structures

1. **Arrays**
    - Fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.
2. **Linked Lists**
    - Sequence of nodes where each node points to the next node.
3. **Stacks**
    - Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) structure.
4. **Queues**
    - First-In-First-Out (FIFO) structure.

## Non-Linear Data Structures

1. **Trees**
    - Hierarchical structure with a root node and child nodes.
    - Types: Binary Tree, Binary Search Tree, AVL Tree, Red-Black Tree, etc.
2. **Graphs**
    - Consists of vertices (nodes) and edges (connections).
    - Types: Directed, Undirected, Weighted, Unweighted,
