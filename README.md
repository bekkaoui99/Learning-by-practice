# Learning by Practice

Learning by practice is a theory that emphasizes the importance of hands-on experience and active participation in the learning process. With this in mind, I decided to start learning Data Structures, Algorithms, and Design Patterns, as they are crucial for us as software engineers.

To enhance this experience, I invited my classmates and friends to join me. By collaborating, we can learn from each other and make the process more enjoyable and effective.

## How We Will Work

I created a folder for each module. Inside each folder, you will find a ReadMe file with detailed instructions and tasks. Once you complete the work, you can push your changes, and we will review them together. This collaborative approach will help us all improve and deepen our understanding.
